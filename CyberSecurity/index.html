				<h3>Common Types of Cyber Attacks</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><b>DDoS</b> - A DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is when a malicious bot not of machines send malicious data packets to a service with the intention of slowing down or bringing down the service for legitimate users.</li>
					<li><b>Phishing</b> - Phishing attacks are probably the most common type of attack due to the ease of undertaking such attack. Millions of emails are sent out with the intention of getting a few individuals to (usually) click a malicious link which will infect the victim machine</li>
					<li><b>Ransomware</b> - A ransomeware attack is undertaken when a victim machine has already been exploited (usually through a trojon download or phishing attack) where most files are encrypted with an RSA-2048 key. The key is exported to the attackers and they demand payment for return of the key although often the key is not returned after payment</li>
					<li><b>MitM attacks</b> - A Man in the Middle attack is any attack where an attacker can access, change, or view your information without your knowledge. An example of this would be an attacker mimicking a Wireless Access point in a public area and then snooping on that data. This is very effectiv in places like shopping centres or airports. The data can even be forwarded to the legitimate WAP after its been intercepted to be harder to detect. It is easily done too through software like OpenWRT</li> 
				</ul>
				<p>These are just a handfuk of attacks, if you'd like to view all of the CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) then click <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/">here</a></p>

			<span class="anchor" id="protection"></span>
			<div class="Protection ContentSection" id="Protection">
				<ul>
					<li><b>Common sense</b> - Common sense is one of the best ways to protect yourself online. If a link is sent to your from an unknown source, don't click it. If something sounds too good to be true (for example offering a free giftcard in exchange for clicking a link) then it is.</li>
					<li><b>Don't reuse passwords</b> - Reusing email and password combinations is the easiest way for your accounts to get hacked. If a service that you signed up for has a data breach then that information will be sold to groups that will then try that combo on many different services which leads to being compromised. To mitigate this, use a password manager (preferably free and open source like KeepassXC) as all of your accounts will use a secure password and if one is breached then only that account will be affected.</li>
					<li><b>Always use encryption</b> - Encryption is one of the best privacy tools avaliable when communicating or browsing the web. Windows has bitlocker that you should always turn on because if your laptop or desktop is stolen then all of your information will be secure if the attackers don't have the keys.
					<li><b>Use free and open source software when possible</b> - Using free and open source software is great for privacy and protection online. The source code is avaliable online so people can scrutinise the code for vulnerabilities which means a lower chance of day-zero exploits. The code is maintained by people that have a passion rather than companies that are chasing profit which means it usually works better too.
